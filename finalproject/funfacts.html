        <h3>Facts</h3>
        <p>*Harry Potter became the first and only known person to survive the Killing Curse.
            On the fateful day of October 31, 1981, Lily Potter made a loving sacrifice to protect her son from Voldemortâ€™s killing curse. Due to the incident, Voldemort accidentally made Harry into a Horcrux where a piece of his soul has been implanted.</p>
        <p>Dumbledore's full name is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
            Better known as simply Albus Dumbledore, the previous Headmaster of Hogwarts was in office for nearly 40 years. Sadly, he was not spared from the story as Severus Snape killed him. Dumbledore was buried in a white marble tomb on the Hogwarts grounds. All in all, Albus Dumbledore was considered as the most powerful wizard of his time.</p>

        <p>Hermione Granger is the only girl of the Golden Trio.
            Recognized as the brightest witch of her generation, Hermione Jean Granger was evidently brilliant, headstrong, and resourceful throughout the series. Harry considers her and Ron his closest friends regardless of her being a Muggle-born. Hence, Hermione is a living example of the misconception of pureblood wizard supremacy.</p>
            
        <p>Ronald Weasley completes the Golden Trio.
            Like his best friends Harry and Hermione, Ron Bilius Weasley is also of House Gryffindor. The tall, gangly, red-haired, and freckled lad met the other two at the Hogwarts Express in 1991. Ron is the youngest son of Arthur and Molly Weasley. Eventually, he married Hermione and had 2 children with her named Hugo and Rose.</p>
