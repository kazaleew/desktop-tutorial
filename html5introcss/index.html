        <h2>The lore behind Halloween</h2>
        <p>Halloween evolved out of a Catholic holiday called All Hallows Eve, which occurs the day before All Saints Day. All Saints Day was generally celebrated on November 1st after Pope Gregory changed it from its original date of May 13th. So Halloween was never a Christian holiday. It was the day before All Saints Day. In the Orthodox Church, All Saints Day continues to be celebrated in late spring on the first Sunday after Pentecost, which in turn is seven weeks after Easter.</p>

        <h3>Halloweens Pagan roots</h3>

        <p>The Pilgrims banned the celebrating of Halloween in America because of its pagan roots. As a matter of fact, Halloween was not celebrated in America until 1845. And it is surrounded by the understanding that during this particular time, a large flood of Irish emigrants came to this country during the Potato Famine of 1845-46. They brought with them the old Druid holiday of Halloween. Gradually, celebrating Halloween spread throughout the rest of the country.</p>
