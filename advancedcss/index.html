            <h2>Have you ever wondered about the significance of pumpkins during Halloween?</h2>
            
            <p>The jack-o’-lantern has a long history with Halloween, although our favorite demonic faces haven’t always been carved out of pumpkins.</p>
          
            <p> Their origin comes from an Irish myth about Stingy Jack, who tricked the Devil for his own monetary gain. When Jack died, God didn’t allow him into heaven, and the Devil didn’t let him into hell, so Jack was sentenced to roam the earth for eternity. In Ireland, people started to carve demonic faces out of turnips to frighten away Jack’s wandering soul. When Irish immigrants moved to the U.S., they began carving jack-o’-lanterns from pumpkins, as these were native to the region.</p>
            
            <p>But how did jack-o’-lanterns become associated with Halloween? Halloween is based on the Celtic festival Samhain, a celebration in ancient Britain and Ireland that marked the end of summer and the beginning of the new year on November 1. It was believed that during Samhain the souls of those who had died that year traveled to the otherworld and that other souls would return to visit their homes.</p>

            <h4>About</h4>
            
            <p>The first step to learning how to carve a convincing jack-o'-lantern actually starts at the pumpkin patch (or your local store). Set yourself up for carving success by selecting a pumpkin in its prime. Choose one with an intact stem—the greener the better.</p>
            
            <p> "The stem is the lifeline to the pumpkin, providing moisture and nutrients even after it's been cut from the vine," Evan says. "A missing stem or one that's brown and brittle means your pumpkin won't last as long."</p>
            
            <p>Keep your uncarved pumpkin out of direct sunlight and as cool as possible, and don't carve it until right before your Halloween party or the big night itself. While an intact pumpkin can easily last a month or more, once you carve it, you're looking at a life expectancy of as little as three days to maybe three weeks. "It is a piece of fruit," Evan says. (For maximum longevity, he stores pumpkins—carved or not—wrapped in plastic wrap in a cool basement or refrigerator when not on display.)</p>

        <p>For some people, pumpkins aren’t just a bit of disposable artwork that will decorate the front steps throughout the Halloween season. These artists take pumpkin carving to elaborate new levels. They might use drills and other specialty tools to achieve the desired effect. Some talented artisans can even carve through only the top layer of pumpkin skin, leaving the flesh beneath to create an eerie glow effect. Artistic pumpkins aren’t necessarily carved with faces. In fact, they can be carved with anything the artist can imagine</p>
